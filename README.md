# OS_BoundaryConstraints
Recreates the default boundary constraints of the Merit Function wizard (Min: 0 | Max: 1E3 | Edge Thickness: 0) at the top of one's Merit Function for variable thicknesses. Sometimes one might edit individual boundary constraints and those need not be overriden by the Default Merit Function. Therefore, one needs to move those boundary constraints above DMFS. The intent of this user extension is to automate this process. The other difference with the Default Merit Function is that only relevant operand are added for a surface type (air vs glass).
