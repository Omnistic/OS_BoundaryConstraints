# OS_BoundaryConstraints
Recreate the default boundary constraints of the Merit Function wizard (0, 1E3, 0) at the top of one's Merit Function. Sometimes one might edit individual boundary constraints and those need not be overriden by the Default Merit Function. Therefore, one needs to move those boundary constraints above DMFS. The intent of this user extension is to automate this process. Other differences with the Default Merit Function are: only relevant operand are added for a surface type (air vs glass), and operands are added for Surface 0.
